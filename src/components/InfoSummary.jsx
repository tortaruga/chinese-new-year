            The chinese zodiac associates each year with an animal, 
            in a cycle that repeats every twelve years. 
            The twelve signs are the following: <strong>rat, ox, tiger,
            rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, 
            monkey, rooster, dog, and pig.</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            Each of them is also associated with a yin or yang force, 
            an element (fire, earth, water, wood, or metal), 
            and one of 12 symbols called Earthly Branches.
          </p>

            the Ten Heavenly Stems (yang wood, yin wood, yang fire, 
            yin fire, yang earth, yin earth, yang metal, yin metal, 
            yang water, yin water).</p>

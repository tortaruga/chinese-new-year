        <p>The traditional Chinese calendar is a <strong>lunisolar calendar</strong>, 
            meaning that it combines monthly lunar cycles with the 
            solar year (while the Gregorian Calendar, 
            commonly used in the West, only uses the solar cycle).
        </p>

        <p>Although modern China mostly uses the Gregorian 
            calendar for official purposes, the traditional Chinese 
            calendar is still culturally significant; for example, 
            it determines the Chinese New Year, and influences 
            festivals and zodiac-based customs.
